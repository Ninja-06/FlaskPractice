To begin with first set your python environment variable as follows....
<<<< export PYTHONPATH="$PWD" >>>>

then run to check whether your environment variable is set or not type...
<<<< echo $PYTHONPATH >>>>
above command should display working directory path

then after writing testcases you can test your api's using 
<<<< pytest -v >>>> 
even there are more commands available if you want descriptive error or success messages
